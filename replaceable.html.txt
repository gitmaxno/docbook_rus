Description

A replaceable is used to mark text that describes what a user is supposed to enter, but not the actual text that the user is supposed to enter.

It is used to identify a class of object in the document, in which the user is expected to replace the text that identifies the class with some specific instance of that class. A canonical example is:

<replaceable>filename</replaceable>

in which the user is expected to provide the name of some specific file to replace the text “filename.”
Processing expectations

Formatted inline. Usually, the text is given special typographic treatment, such as italics, as a clue to the user that this is replaceable text. Often the font used is described in a “conventions” section at the beginning of the document.
