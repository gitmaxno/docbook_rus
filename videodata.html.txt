Description

This element points to an external entity containing video data.
Processing expectations

May be formatted inline or as a displayed block, depending on context. Rendering a video is usually accomplished by reserving a rectangular area on the display and “running” the video in that frame.

There are two ways to provide content for videodata: entityref or fileref. It is best to use only one of these methods. However, if multiple sources are provided, entityref will be used in favor of fileref.
