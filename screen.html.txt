Description

A screen is a verbatim environment for displaying text that the user might see on a computer terminal. It is often used to display the results of a command.

Having less specific semantic overtones, screen is often used wherever a verbatim presentation is desired, but the semantic of programlisting is inappropriate.
Processing expectations

This element is displayed “verbatim”; whitespace and line breaks within this element are significant. The content of a screen element is usually displayed in a fixed-width font.
Attributes

Common attributes and common linking attributes.

continuation

    Determines whether line numbering continues from the previous element or restarts.
    Enumerated values:
    “continues”	

    Line numbering continues from the immediately preceding element with the same name.
    “restarts”	

    Line numbering restarts (begins at 1, usually).
language

    Identifies the language (i.e. programming language) of the verbatim content.
linenumbering

    Determines whether lines are numbered.
    Enumerated values:
    “numbered”	

    Lines are numbered.
    “unnumbered”	

    Lines are not numbered.
startinglinenumber

    Specifies the initial line number.
width

    Specifies the width (in characters) of the element
xml:space

    Can be used to indicate explicitly that whitespace in the verbatim environment is preserved. Whitespace must always be preserved in verbatim environments whether this attribute is specified or not.
    Enumerated values:
    “preserve”	

    Whitespace must be preserved.
