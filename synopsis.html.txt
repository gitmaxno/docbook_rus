Description

A synopsis is a verbatim environment for displaying command, function, and other syntax summaries.

Unlike cmdsynopsis and funcsynopsis which have a complex interior structure, synopsis is simply a verbatim environment.
Processing expectations

This element is displayed “verbatim”; whitespace and line breaks within this element are significant. A synopsis element is usually displayed in a fixed-width font.

language

    Identifies the language (i.e. programming language) of the verbatim content.
