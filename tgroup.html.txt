Description

A tgroup surrounds a logically complete portion of a table. Most tables consist of a single tgroup, but complex tables with widely varying column specifications may be easier to code using multiple tgroups.

The tgroup specifies the number of columns in the table, and contains all of the header, body, and footer rows, along with any additional column or span specifications necessary to express the geometry of the table.

Most of the properties of rows, columns, and cells inherit their default characteristics from the enclosing tgroup.
