Description

This table element identifies a formal table (one with a title). DocBook allows either CALS or HTML tables, both of which describe tables geometrically using rows, columns, and cells.

Tables may include column headers and footers with thead and tfoot, respectively. Use the rowheader attribute to identify row headers.
Processing expectations

Formatted as a displayed block. This element is expected to obey the semantics of the CALS Table Model Document Type Definition [calsdtd].
Attributes

Common attributes and common linking attributes.

colsep

    Specifies the presence or absence of the column separator
    Enumerated values:
    “0”	

    No column separator rule.
    “1”	

    Provide a column separator rule on the right
floatstyle

    Specifies style information to be used when rendering the float
frame

    Specifies how the table is to be framed. Note that there is no way to obtain a border on only the starting edge (left, in left-to-right writing systems) of the table.
    Enumerated values:
    “all”	

    Frame all four sides of the table. In some environments with limited control over table border formatting, such as HTML, this may imply additional borders.
    “bottom”	

    Frame only the bottom of the table.
    “none”	

    Place no border on the table. In some environments with limited control over table border formatting, such as HTML, this may disable other borders as well.
    “sides”	

    Frame the left and right sides of the table.
    “top”	

    Frame the top of the table.
    “topbot”	

    Frame the top and bottom of the table.
label

    Specifies an identifying string for presentation purposes
orient

    Specifies the orientation of the table
    Enumerated values:
    “land”	

    90 degrees counter-clockwise from the rest of the text flow.
    “port”	

    The same orientation as the rest of the text flow.
pgwide

    Indicates if the element is rendered across the column or the page
    Enumerated values:
    “0”	

    The element should be rendered in the current text flow (with the flow column width).
    “1”	

    The element should be rendered across the full text page.
rowheader

    Indicates whether or not the entries in the first column should be considered row headers
    Enumerated values:
    “firstcol”	

    Indicates that entries in the first column of the table are functionally row headers (analogous to the way that a thead provides column headers).
    “norowheader”	

    Indicates that entries in the first column have no special significance with respect to column headers.
rowsep

    Specifies the presence or absence of the row separator
    Enumerated values:
    “0”	

    No row separator rule.
    “1”	

    Provide a row separator rule below
shortentry

    Indicates if the short or long title should be used in a List of Tables
    Enumerated values:
    “0”	

    Indicates that the full title should be used.
    “1”	

    Indicates that the short short title (titleabbrev) should be used.
tabstyle

    Specifies the table style
tocentry

    Indicates if the table should appear in a List of Tables
    Enumerated values:
    “0”	

    Indicates that the table should not occur in the List of Tables.
    “1”	

    Indicates that the table should appear in the List of Tables.
