***** Additional Constraints *****
    * The root element must have a version attribute.
***** Description *****
A section is one of the top-level sectioning elements in a component. There are three types of sectioning elements in DocBook:
    * Explicitly numbered sections, sect1…sect5, which must be properly nested and can only be five levels deep.
    * Recursive sections, which are an alternative to the numbered sections and have unbounded depth.
    * simplesects, which are terminal. The simplesects can occur as the “leaf” sections in recursive sections or any of the numbered sections, or directly in components.
The section element may be more convenient than numbered sections in some authoring environments because instances can be moved around in the document hierarchy without renaming.
None of the sectioning elements is allowed to “float” in a component. You can place paragraphs and other block elements before a section, but you cannot place anything after it.
**** Processing expectations ****
Formatted as a displayed block. Sometimes sections are numbered.
Use of deeply nested sections may cause problems in some processing systems.
**** Attributes ****
Common_attributes and common_linking_attributes.
  label
      Specifies an identifying string for presentation purposes
  status
      Identifies the editorial or publication status of the element on which it occurs
**** Parents ****
These elements contain section: appendix, article, chapter, partintro, preface, section.
