Description

A trademark identifies a legal trademark.

One of the values of the class attribute on trademark is Copyright. DocBook also has a copyright element, but it is confined to meta-information. A copyright in running text is best represented as <trademark class=copyright>.
Processing expectations

Formatted inline.

In addition to trademark, two of the values of the class attribute on productname make assertions about trademarks; presumably the same markup is intended for both trademark and productname when they make assertions about trademarks.
