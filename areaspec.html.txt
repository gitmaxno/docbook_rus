      Enumerated values:
      “calspair”   Coordinates expressed as a pair of CALS graphic coordinates.
      “linecolumn” Coordinates expressed as a line and column.
      “linecolumnpairCoordinates expressed as a pair of lines and columns.
      “linerange”  Coordinates expressed as a line range.
  units
      Indicates that non-standard units are used for this area . In this case otherunits must be specified.
      Enumerated values:
      “otherCoordinates expressed in some non-standard units.
