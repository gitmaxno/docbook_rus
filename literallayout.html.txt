Description

A literallayout is a verbatim environment. Unlike the other verbatim environments, it does not have strong semantic overtones and may not imply a font change.
Processing expectations

This element is displayed “verbatim”; whitespace and line breaks within this element are significant.

Unlike programlisting and screen, which usually imply a font change, literallayout does not. How spaces are to be represented faithfully in a proportional font is not addressed by DocBook.

The class attribute gives users control over the font used in literallayouts. If the class attribute is specified and its value is monospaced, then the literallayout will be presented in a monospaced font, probably the same one used for other verbatim environments. The default value for class is normal, meaning that no font change will occur.
Attributes

Common attributes and common linking attributes.

class

    Specifies the class of literal layout
    Enumerated values:
    “monospaced”	

    The literal layout should be formatted with a monospaced font
    “normal”	

    The literal layout should be formatted with the current font
continuation

    Determines whether line numbering continues from the previous element or restarts.
    Enumerated values:
    “continues”	

    Line numbering continues from the immediately preceding element with the same name.
    “restarts”	

    Line numbering restarts (begins at 1, usually).
language

    Identifies the language (i.e. programming language) of the verbatim content.
linenumbering

    Determines whether lines are numbered.
    Enumerated values:
    “numbered”	

    Lines are numbered.
    “unnumbered”	

    Lines are not numbered.
startinglinenumber

    Specifies the initial line number.
xml:space

    Can be used to indicate explicitly that whitespace in the verbatim environment is preserved. Whitespace must always be preserved in verbatim environments whether this attribute is specified or not.
    Enumerated values:
    “preserve”	

    Whitespace must be preserved.
