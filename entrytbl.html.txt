Description

The entrytbl element allows for a single level of nesting within CALS tables.

An entry table may occur in a row instead of an entry. An entrytbl has most of the elements of a table but may not include itself, thus limiting nesting to a single level.

An entrytbl can span horizontally (across columns), but it cannot span across rows. Whether this is by accident or by design is unclear, but it has always been that way in CALS.
Processing expectations

This element is expected to obey the semantics of the CALS Table Model Document Type Definition [calsdtd].

The content of entrytbl is formatted, as a table, to fit within the table cell that it occupies. Horizontal and vertical spanning may allow an entrytbl to occupy several physical cells in the table that contains it.

If multiple entrytbls occur in a single row, formatters that support entrytbl are not required to ensure that subrows within the various tables are vertically aligned.

Many formatters are incapable of supporting entrytbls. This is an interchange issue. See Appendix D, Interchanging DocBook Documents.
