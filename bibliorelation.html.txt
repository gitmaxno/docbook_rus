Description

The bibliorelation element satisfies the relation element of the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative.

The Dublin Core defines relation as “a reference to a related resource.” It goes on to note that “recommended best practice is to reference the resource by means of a string or number conforming to a formal identification system.”

DocBook V4.2 added bibliocoverage, bibliorelation, and bibliosource to make the DocBook meta-information wrappers a complete superset of the Dublin Core.
