***** Description *****
Most steps in a procedure are sequential: do the first, then the second, then the third. Sometimes procedures provide an explicit ordering: do step 7 next.
The stepalternatives element was added to support the semantics of alternative steps: perform exactly one of the following steps. The reader is presumably given some criteria for deciding which one to choose, but the significant difference is that only one of the steps is performed.
