Description

Identifies a “head” entry in an HTML table.
Processing expectations

This element is expected to obey the semantics described in Tables, as specified in XHTML 1.0 [XHTML].
Attributes

abbr

    Provides an abbreviated form of the cell's content and may be rendered by user agents when appropriate in place of the cell's content. Abbreviated names should be short since user agents may render them repeatedly. For instance, speech synthesizers may render the abbreviated headers relating to a particular cell before rendering that cell's content.
align

    Specifies the alignment of data and the justification of text in a cell.
    Enumerated values:
    “left”	

    Left-flush data/Left-justify text. This is the default value for table data.
    “center”	

    Center data/Center-justify text. This is the default value for table headers.
    “right”	

    Right-flush data/Right-justify text.
    “justify”	

    Double-justify text.
    “char”	

    Align text around a specific character. If a user agent doesn't support character alignment, behavior in the presence of this value is unspecified.
axis

    This attribute may be used to place a cell into conceptual categories that can be considered to form axes in an n-dimensional space. User agents may give users access to these categories (e.g., the user may query the user agent for all cells that belong to certain categories, the user agent may present a table in the form of a table of contents, etc.). Please consult an HTML reference for more details.
char

    This attribute specifies a single character within a text fragment to act as an axis for alignment. The default value for this attribute is the decimal point character for the current language as set by the lang attribute (e.g., the period in English and the comma in French). User agents are not required to support this attribute.
charoff

    When present, this attribute specifies the offset to the first occurrence of the alignment character on each line. If a line doesn't include the alignment character, it should be horizontally shifted to end at the alignment position. When charoff is used to set the offset of an alignment character, the direction of offset is determined by the current text direction (set by the dir attribute). In left-to-right texts (the default), offset is from the left margin. In right-to-left texts, offset is from the right margin. User agents are not required to support this attribute.
    Enumerated values:
    xsd:integer	

    An explicit offset.
    xsd:string (Pattern: “[0-9]+%”)	

    A percentage offset.
class

    This attribute assigns a class name or set of class names to an element. Any number of elements may be assigned the same class name or names. Multiple class names must be separated by white space characters.
colspan

    Specifies the number of columns spanned by the current cell. The default value of this attribute is one (“1” ). The value zero (“0” ) means that the cell spans all columns from the current column to the last column of the column group (colgroup ) in which the cell is defined.
headers

    Specifies the list of header cells that provide header information for the current data cell. The value of this attribute is a space-separated list of cell names; those cells must be named by setting their id attribute. Authors generally use the headers attribute to help non-visual user agents render header information about data cells (e.g., header information is spoken prior to the cell data), but the attribute may also be used in conjunction with style sheets.
lang

    This attribute specifies the base language of an element's attribute values and text content. The default value of this attribute is unknown.
onclick

    Occurs when the pointing device button is clicked over an element.
ondblclick

    Occurs when the pointing device button is double clicked over an element.
onkeydown

    Occurs when a key is pressed down over an element.
onkeypress

    Occurs when a key is pressed and released over an element.
onkeyup

    Occurs when a key is released over an element.
onmousedown

    Occurs when the pointing device button is pressed over an element.
onmousemove

    Occurs when the pointing device is moved while it is over an element.
onmouseout

    Occurs when the pointing device is moved away from an element.
onmouseover

    Occurs when the pointing device is moved onto an element.
onmouseup

    Occurs when the pointing device button is released over an element.
rowspan

    Specifies the number of rows spanned by the current cell. The default value of this attribute is one (“1” ). The value zero (“0” ) means that the cell spans all rows from the current row to the last row of the table section (thead , tbody , or tfoot ) in which the cell is defined.
scope

    Specifies the set of data cells for which the current header cell provides header information. This attribute may be used in place of the headers attribute, particularly for simple tables.
    Enumerated values:
    “row”	

    The current cell provides header information for the rest of the row that contains it
    “col”	

    The current cell provides header information for the rest of the column that contains it.
    “rowgroup”	

    The header cell provides header information for the rest of the row group that contains it.
    “colgroup”	

    The header cell provides header information for the rest of the column group that contains it.
style

    This attribute specifies style information for the current element.
title

    This attribute offers advisory information about the element for which it is set.
valign

    Specifies the vertical position of data within a cell.
    Enumerated values:
    “top”	

    Cell data is flush with the top of the cell.
    “middle”	

    Cell data is centered vertically within the cell. This is the default value.
    “bottom”	

    Cell data is flush with the bottom of the cell.
    “baseline”	

    All cells in the same row as a cell whose valign attribute has this value should have their textual data positioned so that the first text line occurs on a baseline common to all cells in the row. This constraint does not apply to subsequent text lines in these cells.
