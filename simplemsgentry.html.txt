***** Description *****
A simplemsgentry is a simpler alternative to msgentry. In a msgset, each simplemsgentry contains the text of a message and its explanation.
**** Processing expectations ****
Formatted as a displayed block.
**** Backward incompatibilities ****
In DocBook V5.0, the audience, level, and origin attributes are accidentally misspelled. The attribute “msgaud” should be spelled “audience”; the attribute “msglevel” should be spelled “level”; and the attribute “msgorig” should be spelled “origin”. Those are the spellings in DocBook V4.5.
Unfortunately, the attribute name “audience” has subsequently been added to all elements as an effectivity attribute. Because there’s no way to resolve that conflict now, the DocBook Technical Committee has decided to accept the error and leave the misspelled attribute names in place going forward.
