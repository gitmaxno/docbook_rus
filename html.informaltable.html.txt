***** Description *****
This informaltable element identifies an informal HTML table (one without a caption). DocBook allows either CALS or HTML tables, both of which describe tables geometrically using rows, columns, and cells.
HTML tables may include column headers and footers. To identify a row header, use a th in the row.
**** Why arenâ€™t HTML tables in the HTML namespace? ****
HTML tables were introduced in DocBook V4.3, which was not in a namespace and was defined normatively with a DTD. DTDs do not support namespaces very well. The Technical Committee decided to simply add the HTML element names to DocBook. This solution simplified specification, avoided issues of namespace support in DTDs, and solved the most compelling use case: cut-and-paste of simple, text-only HTML tables into DocBook.
Strictly speaking, it would be incorrect to put these elements in the XHTML namespace because the DocBook common attributes are allowed on all of them and the td and th elements have very different content models than their HTML counterparts.
**** Processing expectations ****
Formatted as a displayed block. This element is expected to obey the semantics described in Tables, as specified in XHTML 1.0 [XHTML].
**** Attributes ****
  border
      Specifies the width (in pixels only) of the frame around a table.
  cellpadding
      Specifies the amount of space between the border of the cell and its contents. If the value of this attribute is a pixel length, all four margins should be this distance from the contents. If the value of the attribute is a percentage length, the top and bottom margins should be equally separated from the content based on a percentage of the available vertical space, and the left and right margins should be equally separated from the content based on a percentage of the available horizontal space.
      Enumerated values:
      xsd:integer                     An explicit padding.
      xsd:string (Pattern: â€œ[0-9]+%âA percentage padding.
  cellspacing
      Specifies how much space the user agent should leave between the left side of the table and the left-hand side of the leftmost column, the top of the table and the top side of the topmost row, and so on for the right and bottom of the table. The attribute also specifies the amount of space to leave between cells.
      Enumerated values:
      xsd:integer                     An explicit spacing.
      xsd:string (Pattern: â€œ[0-9]+%âA percentage spacing.
  class
      This attribute assigns a class name or set of class names to an element. Any number of elements may be assigned the same class name or names. Multiple class names must be separated by white space characters.
  frame
      Specifies which sides of the frame surrounding a table will be visible.
      Enumerated values:
      â€œvoidâ€No sides. This is the default value.
      â€œaboveâThe top side only.
      â€œbelowâThe bottom side only.
      â€œhsidesThe top and bottom sides only.
      â€œlhsâ€The left-hand side only.
      â€œrhsâ€The right-hand side only.
      â€œvsidesThe right and left sides only.
      â€œboxâ€All four sides.
      â€œborderAll four sides.
  lang
      This attribute specifies the base language of an element's attribute values and text content. The default value of this attribute is unknown.
  onclick
      Occurs when the pointing device button is clicked over an element.
  ondblclick
      Occurs when the pointing device button is double clicked over an element.
  onkeydown
      Occurs when a key is pressed down over an element.
  onkeypress
      Occurs when a key is pressed and released over an element.
  onkeyup
      Occurs when a key is released over an element.
  onmousedown
      Occurs when the pointing device button is pressed over an element.
  onmousemove
      Occurs when the pointing device is moved while it is over an element.
  onmouseout
      Occurs when the pointing device is moved away from an element.
  onmouseover
      Occurs when the pointing device is moved onto an element.
  onmouseup
      Occurs when the pointing device button is released over an element.
  rules
      Specifies which rules will appear between cells within a table. The rendering of rules is user agent dependent.
      Enumerated values:
      â€œnoneâ€No rules. This is the default value.
      â€œgroupsRules will appear between row groups (see thead, tfoot, and tbody) and column groups (see colgroup and col) only.
      â€œrowsâ€Rules will appear between rows only.
      â€œcolsâ€Rules will appear between columns only.
      â€œallâ€Rules will appear between all rows and columns.
  style
      This attribute specifies style information for the current element.
  summary
      Provides a summary of the table's purpose and structure for user agents rendering to non-visual media such as speech and Braille.
  title
      This attribute offers advisory information about the element for which it is set.
  width
      Specifies the desired width of the entire table and is intended for visual user agents. When the value is a percentage value, the value is relative to the user agent's available horizontal space. In the absence of any width specification, table width is determined by the user agent.
      Enumerated values:
      xsd:integer                     An explicit width.
      xsd:string (Pattern: â€œ[0-9]+%âA percentage width.
