Description

The article element is a general-purpose container for articles. The content model is both quite complex and rather loose in order to accommodate the wide range of possible article structures. Although changes to the article element have been discussed on several occasions, no better model has been presented.

An article may include a table of contents and multiple lists of tables, figures, and so on before the main text of the article. It may also include a number of common back matter components at the end.
Processing expectations

Formatted as a displayed block. Frequently causes a forced page break in print media. May be numbered separately and presented in the table of contents.
