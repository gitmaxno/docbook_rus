***** Description *****
The tfoot wrapper identifies the rows of a table that form the foot of the table, as distinct from the header (thead) and body (tbody) rows.
Footer rows are always rendered at the end of the table, despite their logical placement near the beginning.
**** Processing expectations ****
This element is expected to obey the semantics of the CALS Table Model Document Type Definition [calsdtd]. Footer rows are often presented in an alternate typographic style, such as boldface.
In paged media, if a table spans across multiple pages, footer rows are printed on the bottom of each page.
In our experience, relatively few formatters handle footer rows correctly.
