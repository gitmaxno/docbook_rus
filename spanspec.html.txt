Description

A spanspec associates a name with a span between two columns in a table. In the body of the table, cells can refer to the span by name. Cells that refer to a span will span horizontally from the first column to the last column, inclusive.

Cells can also form spans directly, by naming the start and end columns themselves. The added benefit of a spanspec is that it can associate formatting information (such as alignment and table rule specifications) with the span. This information does not need to be repeated then, on each spanning cell.
Processing expectations

Suppressed. This element is expected to obey the semantics of the CALS Table Model Document Type Definition [calsdtd].

The namest and nameend attributes of a spanspec must refer to named colspecs in the same table. In other words, if the spanspec:

t<spanspec spanname="fullyear" namest="jan" nameend="dec"/>

exists in a table, colspecs named “jan” and “dec” must also exist in the same table.
