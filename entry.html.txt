Description

An entry is a cell in a table.

Each entry may specify its starting column. Entries that do not explicitly specify a starting column begin implicitly in the column that is immediately adjacent to the preceding cell. Note that entrys with the morerows attribute from preceding rows implicitly occupy cells in the succeeding rows.

A row is not required to be full. It is legal for some entries to be completely absent (at the beginning, middle, or end of a row).
Processing expectations

This element is expected to obey the semantics of the CALS Table Model Document Type Definition [calsdtd].

The content of entry is formatted to fit within the table cell that it occupies. Horizontal and vertical spanning may allow the content of an entry to occupy several physical cells.
