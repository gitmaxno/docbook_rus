***** tfoot (db.cals.tfoot) *****
tfoot — A table footer consisting of one or more rows.
***** Synopsis *****
    * Sequence of:
          o Zero or more of:
                # colspec
          o One or more of:
                # row (db.row)
***** Attributes *****
Common_attributes and common_linking_attributes.
Additional attributes:
    * valign (enumeration)
          o “bottom”
          o “middle”
          o “top”
***** Description *****
The tfoot wrapper identifies the rows of a table that form the foot of the table, as distinct from the header (thead) and body (tbody) rows.
Footer rows are always rendered at the end of the table, despite their logical placement near the beginning.
**** Processing expectations ****
This element is expected to obey the semantics of the CALS Table Model Document Type Definition [calsdtd]. Footer rows are often presented in an alternate typographic style, such as boldface.
In paged media, if a table spans across multiple pages, footer rows are printed on the bottom of each page.
In our experience, relatively few formatters handle footer rows correctly.
**** Attributes ****
Common_attributes and common_linking_attributes.
  valign
      Specifies the vertical alignment of text in an entry.
      Enumerated values:
      “bottomAligned on the bottom of the entry.
      “middleAligned in the middle.
      “top”Aligned at the top of the entry.
**** Parents ****
