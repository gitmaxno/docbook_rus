$Revision$
The quantity of information about XML grows daily. This appendix collects the references mentioned explicitly in this book and identifies additional resources related to DocBook and XML.
**** 1. Latest Versions of DocBook Schemas ****
Since July, 1998, the DocBook Technical Committee of OASIS (Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards) at http://www.oasis-open.org/ has been responsible for the advancement and maintenance of the DocBook schemas, including any schemas from a subcommittee that are approved by the DocBook Technical Committee.
The latest releases of DocBook can be obtained from the official DocBook home page at http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/. All normative versions of the DocBook standard, including derivatives like the Publisher’s schema, are available at this site.
Information about the most commonly used, non-normative customizations of the DocBook schema, such as Simplified DocBook and DocBook Website, can be found at http://docbook.org/.
**** Note ****
The only schemas that are considered normative standards are those that have been approved through the OASIS process by the DocBook Technical Committee.
**** 2. DocBook and XML Resources on the Web ****
The following websites and lists are excellent starting places for information about DocBook and XML:

      The most recent online version of this book can be found at http://docbook.org/.
  DocBook mailing lists
      OASIS maintains two public DocBook mailing lists:
        docbook@lists.oasis-open.org
            This list is for general questions, comments, and discussion about DocBook, including questions about the schemas, syntax, semantics, and markup.
            An archive is maintained at: http://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/docbook/.
        docbook-apps@lists.oasis-open.org
            This list is for questions, comments, and discussion about implementing DocBook, including questions about formatting, processing, using the stylesheets, and editing.
            An archive is maintained at: http://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/docbook-apps/.
      You can subscribe to either list at: http://www.oasis-open.org/mlmanage/.
  DocBook stylesheets
      The DocBook_stylesheets are a set of stylesheets for use with an XSLT engine like xsltproc or Saxon. The stylesheets can transform DocBook XML documents (including documents using DocBook 5.0 and earlier versions) into output formats like HTML, PDF, various help formats, and the ePub ebook format. The stylesheets are open source software maintained by the DocBook community.
  DocBook Wiki
      The DocBook_Wiki contains a wide variety of DocBook information, from FAQs to lists of consultants.
  Robin Cover’s “Cover Pages”
      A large list of XML resources: http://xml.coverpages.org.

**** 9. XML Tools ****
Here is information about some of the tools mentioned in this book. If you are running Linux, you may be able to load some of these tools using a package manager like Synaptic, yum, or apt. Needless to say, this is not a comprehensive list; there are other capable tools available. However, these are a good starting place.
  RELAX NG
      A variety of tools that support RELAX NG can be found at: http://relaxng.org/. These include:
        MSV
            Sun Multi-Schema XML Validator (from Sun Microsystems). MSV is an open source program that validates RELAX NG as well as other schema languages including W3C XML Schema.
            https://msv.dev.java.net/
        Jing
            An open source RELAX NG validator that supports both compact and XML syntax.
            http://www.thaiopensource.com/relaxng/jing.html
        Trang
            An open source program that is a companion to Jing, Trang converts between various XML schema languages. It supports both compact and XML syntax for RELAX NG, XML 1.0 DTDs, and W3C XML Schemas, though it only supports W3C XML Schemas for output.
            http://www.thaiopensource.com/relaxng/trang.html
        EMACS nXML mode
            This is an open source addon for emacs that supports syntax-directed editing using a RELAX NG compact mode schema. It validates as you type and will show you at any point what the valid set of elements, attributes, and attribute values is. It also supports automatic completion of partially typed elements, attributes, and attribute values.
            http://www.thaiopensource.com/nxml-mode/
  Saxon
      Saxon is an XSLT processor. The basic processor is available as an open source product, and there are also commercial versions that offer additional features. The latest versions of Saxon support both XSLT 1.0 and 2.0.
      http://saxon.sourceforge.net/
  xsltproc
      Xsltproc is an open source XSLT processor that supports XSLT 1.0.
      http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/xsltproc2.html
  <oXygen/> XML Editor
      The <oXygen/> XML Editor is a popular commercial editor. The latest versions support DocBook V5.0, including both the RELAX NG and Schematron rules. It is also integrated with the DocBook stylesheets.
      http://oxygenxml.com
  XMLmind XML Editor (XXE)
      The XMLmind XML Editor is a popular commercial editor that comes in two varieties, a personal edition and a professional edition. The personal edition is free for non-commercial use. Both versions support DocBook V5.0.
