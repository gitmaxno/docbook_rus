***** Description *****
A methodsynopsis contains the syntax summary of a method (generally speaking, methods in the object-oriented programming language sense).
This is one of the few places where DocBook attempts to model as well as describe. Unlike funcsynopsis which was designed with C language function prototypes in mind, the content model of methodsynopsis was designed to capture a wide range of semantics.
**** Processing expectations ****
For the most part, the processing application is expected to generate all of the parentheses, semicolons, commas, and so on required in the rendered synopsis.
**** Attributes ****
Common_attributes and common_linking_attributes.
  language
      Identifies the language (i.e. programming language) of the content.
