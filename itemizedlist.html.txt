Description

In an itemizedlist, each member of the list is marked with a bullet, dash, or other symbol.
Processing expectations

Formatted as a displayed block.

DocBook specifies neither the initial mark nor the sequence of marks to be used in nested lists. If explicit control is desired, the mark attribute should be used. The values of the mark attribute are expected to be keywords, not representations (numerical character references, entities, etc.) of the actual mark.

DocBook does not specify a set of appropriate keywords.

In order to enforce a standard set of marks at your organization, it may be useful to construct a customization layer that limits the values of the mark attribute to an enumerated list. See Chapter 5, Customizing DocBook.
