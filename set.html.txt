***** Description *****
A set is a collection of books. Placing multiple books in a set, as opposed to publishing each of them separately, has the advantage that ID/IDREF links can then be used across all books.
A set is the top of the DocBook structural hierarchy. Although sets can contain other sets, nothing else can contain them.
