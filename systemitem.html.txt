Description

A systemitem identifies any system-related item or term. The class attribute defines a number of common system-related terms.

Many inline elements in DocBook are, in fact, system related. Some of the objects identified by the class attribute on systemitem may eventually migrate out to become separate inline elements, and some inline elements may migrate into systemitem.
Processing expectations

Formatted inline.
