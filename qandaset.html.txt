Description

A qandaset is a list consisting of questions and answers. A qandaset can be divided into sections.

Every entry in a qandaset must contain a question, but answers are optional (some questions have no answers), and may be repeated (some questions have more than one answer).

Common uses for qandasets include reader questionnaires and lists of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs). For the purpose of a FAQ, DocBook V3.1 added the FAQ class to article.
