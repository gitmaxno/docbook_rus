***** Synopsis *****
    * Zero or more of:
          o text
          o application
***** Attributes *****
Common_attributes and common_linking_attributes.
***** Description *****
The refclass element describes the applicability or scope of a refentry. A refclass might indicate that the entry was only applicable to a particular application, for example, or only to a particular vendor’s operating system.
**** Processing expectations ****
May be formatted inline or as a displayed block, depending on context. Sometimes suppressed.
Formatting reference pages may require a fairly sophisticated processing system. Much of the meta-information about a reference page (its name, type, purpose, title, and classification) is stored in wrappers near the beginning of the refentry.
Common presentational features, such as titles and running heads, may require data from several of these wrappers plus some generated text. Other formatting often requires that these elements be reordered.
**** Parents ****
These elements contain refclass: refnamediv.
**** Children ****
The following elements occur in refclass: text, application.
***** Examples *****
See refentry for an example using this element.
