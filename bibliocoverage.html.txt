Description

The bibliocoverage element is equivalent to the coverage element of the Dublin Core Metadata Element Set [DCMI].

The Dublin Core defines coverage as “the extent or scope of the content of the resource.” It goes on to say:

    Spatial topic and spatial applicability may be a named place or a location specified by its geographic coordinates. Temporal topic may be a named period, date, or date range. A jurisdiction may be a named administrative entity or a geographic place to which the resource applies.

    Recommended best practice is to use a controlled vocabulary such as the Thesaurus of Geographic Names Online []. Where appropriate, named places or time periods can be used in preference to numeric identifiers such as sets of coordinates or date ranges.

DocBook V4.2 added bibliocoverage, bibliorelation, and bibliosource to make the DocBook meta-information wrappers a superset of the Dublin Core.
Processing expectations

Formatted inline. Sometimes suppressed.

This element is used for both spatial and temporal coverage, but only one should be specified at a time. In other words, on any given instance of the bibliocoverage element, specify either the spatial attribute or the temporal attribute, but not both.
