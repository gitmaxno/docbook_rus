A segmentedlist consists of a set of headings (segtitles) and a list of parallel sets of elements. Each set of elements is stored in a seglistitem.
**** Processing expectations ****
Segmented lists can be formatted in a number of ways. Two popular formats are tabular and as a list of repeated headings and elements. In a tabular presentation, each seglistitem is a row in the table. In the list presentation, each seglistitem contains a block of heading/element pairs.
DocBook cannot detect errors caused by too many or too few segs in a seglistitem. You will have to rely on external processes to find those errors.
